Try1: par_block.h par_block.c
optimizations used:
  pthread with 8 threads
  instruction level parallelism for neighbour_count
  reduce usage of mod function to only at margins of block
  
Try2: par_blk_barrier.h, par_blk_barrier.c
optimizations used:
  pthread with 8 threads
  instruction level parallelism for neighbour_count
  wait on barrier instead of join

Try3: par_blk_margin.h, par_blk_margin.c
optimizations used:
  pthread with 8 + 1 threads ( + 1 for margin)
  instruction level parallelism for neighbour_count
  margin of the whole board calculated separately by a designated thread. This helps to get rid of modulo op for most cells and reduce cache misses at margin.
